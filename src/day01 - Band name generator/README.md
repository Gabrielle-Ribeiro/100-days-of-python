## Tips

If you are new in programming, and you are stuck trying to undestand how some piece of code works, you can use a pretty nice tool called [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).

Thonny is a Python IDE for beginners. It will execute your Python code and show visually which operations are being execute and what is happenning in every step of your code.
