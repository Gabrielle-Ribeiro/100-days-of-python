# Password Generator

**Level:** Beginner.

## About the Project

Security is a big concern nowadays. Thinking on it, we need to use strong passwords, and a different password in each account. But choose a good password is not a easy task, so this project brings to us a password generator.

You just need to specify:

 - How many letters do you want 
 - How many symbols do you want
 - And how many numbers you want.

Then it is generated a random password with the specifyed conditions.
