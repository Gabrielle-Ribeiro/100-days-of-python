## About the project

<p align="justify">This is a simple project of day #01 of the 100 days of Code in Python. This code consists of a name generator for bands, based on your answers to some questions.</p>

<p align="justify">First, it asks you what is the name of the city that you grew up. Then, it asks your pets name. The name of your band is generated by join the string of the city name with the string of the pets name.</p>

<p align="justify">The objective of this project is to exercise the concepts learned in lesson 1, about the print() function, input() function and variables.</p>
